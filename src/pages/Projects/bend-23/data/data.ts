    title: "The Bend 23 Delay Pedal",
    body: "Bend 23 is a delay pedal that goes beyond standard functionality. It has a digital low-frequency oscillator (LFO) that adds a unique twist to your sound. This LFO modulates the delay time, not in a traditional linear way, but through a fascinating interplay of light and electronics.",

  magic: {
    title: "The Magic of LFO and Light Interaction",
    body: "Here's the magic: the LFO modulates with an LED and a light-dependent resistor (LDR) picks up the oscillation and controls the delay time. This unconventional setup creates a non-linear relationship, translating the LFO's waveform into unexpected and captivating effects.",

    title: "Embrace the Unexpected",
    body: "I'm a firm believer in the power of embracing the unexpected. Sometimes, the most beautiful sounds arise from imperfections. In the case of Bend 23, the non-linearity introduced by the LED/LDR interaction becomes a source of creative exploration, generating a myriad of unique delay effects.",
