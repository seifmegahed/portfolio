During my time at Lectro I worked closely with the accounting department, and the accounting manager was my closest friend at the company. 
The way they handled their data was through locally stored Excel sheet files that were passed around in USB flash drives.
This system was inefficient, they had a lot of files that are named "final" and "finalfinal" et cetera. 
As for my department, we worked using google sheets on the cloud which made things more central and allowed for a single source of truth.
I tried to convince the accounting manager to switch to google sheets a couple of times, but it was hard to switch over during the financial year.
In the beginning of 2020, he decided that it was time, and we spent a week working late nights to get it up and running.

This project is what sparked my passion for web development. I wrote UIs using Google Apps Script, HTML, and css. This ecosystem was part of the 
Google Workspace platform that allowed you to build APIs, Web Apps, and extensions, with close integration with their products. Google Apps Script
is a light weight language based on and written in javascript. This ecosystem only allowed for software to be developed on their platform on the web.
So the IDE was very limited and the javascript written for the html would only be written inside <scrip> tags in HTML files.

  "The project was a success and has proven to be much more efficient, user-friendly, and accurate than the previous system. The sheets and UIs are still being used by the company to this day, and every now and then they call me to add more features. This year alone, they did over 12.5k entries.";
